# Wide Integration Locally with Delivery

Wild stands for **Wide Integration Locally with Delivery**. Due to its ***Wild*** nature, it fills the gap between the developer and the CI/CD platform by allowing to run locally and on the build server the exact same integration and deployment scripts.

Developers can test the operation of the CI/CD chain on their local station and no longer have to wait and wonder what will happen once their code is pushed on the integration servers.

**Wild** fills the missing link of the DevOps approach and its *shift-left* principal herein. With **Wild** the shifts are so close to the developer that they no longer exist. This is where **Wild** can be described as ***shift-less*** framework.
